## Explanation of Cron Expression Fields

A Quartz Cron expression consists of six required fields (seconds, minutes, hours, day of month, month, day of week) and an optional year field:

1. **Seconds** (0-59)
2. **Minutes** (0-59)
3. **Hours** (0-23)
4. **Day of month** (1-31)
5. **Month** (1-12 or JAN-DEC)
6. **Day of week** (0-7 or SUN-SAT, where 0 and 7 are Sunday)
7. **Year** (optional, 1970-2099)

## Special Characters

- **`*`**: All values
- **`,`**: Separate items of a list
- **`-`**: Range of values
- **`/`**: Increment by a value
- **`?`**: No specific value (used for day of month and day of week)
- **`L`**: Last day of the month or week
- **`W`**: Nearest weekday (e.g., `15W` means nearest weekday to the 15th of the month)
- **`#`**: The nth weekday of the month (e.g., `2#1` means the first Monday of the month)
